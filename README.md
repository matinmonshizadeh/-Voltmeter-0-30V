# Voltmeter 0-30V

### To make Voltmeter 0-30V you are going to need:
1. Perforated Board (1600 points)
2. Square Battery
3. Battery Clip Connector
4. AVR Programmer
5. Character LCD (2 X 16)
6. (5.813K) Ohm Resistor
7. (43.23K) Ohm Resistor
8. Solder Wire
9. Jumper Wire
10. 2 Pin Male Connector
11. 2 Pin Female Connector
12. LM7805 Regulator
13. 10µF 16V Radial Electrolytic Capacitor
14. 100µF 16V Radial Electrolytic Capacitor
15. 100nF Ceramic Capacitor
16. ATmega32 Microcontroller
17. 40 Pin IC Socket
18. Female Pin Header
19. Male Pin Header
20. 6 Pin Push Button On/Off Switch
21. 2 Pin Terminal Block
22. (10K) Ohm Potentiometer
23. Two Pieces of wire

## Project Steps:
This project will be divided into two hardware and software sections, firstly, the hardware section We will pay for it.

### Hardware Section:
- At first, we sand the perforated board until its surface is shiny.
- Then, we need to solder the female and male pins to the 16th pin of the LCD (The purpose of this work is to sell it because LCD is a relatively expensive part Do not solder directly on the board and instead use a male header pin This LCD can be used in another circuit in the future)
- In the next step, we will solder the rest of the parts. (resistors, capacitors, connectors. 2-pin male connector, potentiometer, 1x40 female header pin, two-pin terminal, 6-pin switch Regulator, on/off)
- We solder the 40-pin IC socket on the board A microcontroller is a relatively expensive piece, don't solder it directly on the board Instead, we use a 40-pin IC socket so that it can be connected to the microcontroller in the future used another circuit)
